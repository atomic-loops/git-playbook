1. Contributors fork the main repository
2. Contributors create feature/fix in their fork
3. Pull request submitted from fork to main project
4. Automated CI runs tests and checks
5. Core team reviews PR (requires 2 approvals)
6. PR merged into `main` with linear history (rebase)
7. Regular releases created with semantic versioning
8. Release branches only created for major versions

### Key Tools and Automation
- GitHub Actions for CI
- Probot for automated contributor guidance
- Conventional commits for automated releases
- Codecov for test coverage tracking

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Scales well for many contributors
- Clean project history with linear commits
- Low maintenance for core team
- Good for community contributions

**Cons:**
- Higher barrier to entry for new contributors
- More complex for large features

### Workflow Overview
This agency uses a standardized branching model across all client projects, with client-specific deployment processes.

```
main (production)
  ↑
staging (client review)
  ↑
develop (internal integration)
  ↑
feature branches
```

### Process Steps
1. All features branch from `develop`
2. Internal review and testing on `develop`
3. Periodic merges from `develop` to `staging` for client review
4. Client approval triggers merge to `main`
5. Client-specific deployment process from `main`
6. Hotfixes can go directly to `staging` or `main` with approval

### Key Tools and Automation
- GitLab for repository management
- Client-specific CI/CD pipelines
- Automated environment provisioning
- Pre-commit hooks for code standards

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Consistent process across all client projects
