## üìö Curriculum Overview

This playbook is designed as a structured learning path for developers and teams to master Git and GitHub workflows. Each module builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical examples.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this playbook, you will:
- Understand Git fundamentals and version control concepts
- Master branching strategies and collaborative workflows
- Implement effective code review processes
- Establish release management and semantic versioning
- Follow industry best practices for team collaboration

## üß† How to Use This Playbook

This playbook can be used in several ways depending on your experience level, goals, and available time:

### Learning Paths

1. **Complete Beginner Path (20-30 hours)**
   - Work through all modules sequentially
   - Complete all exercises in each module
   - Time commitment: 2-3 hours per module

2. **Experienced Developer Path (10-15 hours)**
   - Start with [Module 4: Branching & Merging](./04-branching/README.md)
   - Focus on Modules 5-11 for advanced topics
   - Refer to earlier modules as needed for review
   - Time commitment: 1-2 hours per module

3. **Team Onboarding Path (8-10 hours)**
   - All team members start with [Module 1](./01-introduction/README.md) and [Module 2](./02-setup/README.md)
   - Cover [Module 9: Team Best Practices](./09-best-practices/README.md) as a group
   - Assign specific modules to team members based on roles
   - Time commitment: 1 hour per module + team discussions

4. **Quick Reference (As needed)**
   - Bookmark the [Quick Reference Guide](./reference/README.md)
   - Use the [Command Cheat Sheet](./reference/cheat-sheet.md) and [Troubleshooting Guide](./reference/troubleshooting.md)
   - Refer to specific sections as issues arise

### Suggested Study Methods

- **Individual Learning**: Set aside dedicated time each week (2-3 hours) to work through one module
- **Pair Learning**: Work through modules with a colleague, discussing concepts and helping each other
- **Team Workshops**: Host weekly 1-hour sessions to discuss a module as a group
- **Practice Projects**: Create a sandbox repository to practice concepts from each module

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **Workflow Note:**
> The standard workflow is to create feature and fix branches from the `dev` branch, merge them into `dev` via pull requests, and then merge `dev` into `main` for production releases. This keeps `main` stable and production-ready while allowing collaborative development in `dev`.

1. Start with [Module 1](./01-introduction/README.md) if you're new to Git
2. Jump to specific modules based on your current knowledge level
3. Follow the practical exercises in each module
4. Use the [Quick Reference](./reference/README.md) for command lookups

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Resources

- [Quick Reference Guide](./reference/README.md)
- [Command Cheat Sheet](./reference/cheat-sheet.md)
- [Troubleshooting Guide](./reference/troubleshooting.md)
- [Templates & Examples](./templates/README.md)
