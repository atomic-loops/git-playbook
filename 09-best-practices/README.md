# Module 9: Team Best Practices

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement effective commit message conventions
- Create atomic commits that enhance project history
- Maintain a clean and deployable main branch
- Establish productive team workflows
- Use feature flags and branch naming conventions

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Conventions

### Why Commit Messages Matter

Good commit messages:
- **Communicate intent** to future developers
- **Enable automation** (changelog generation, releases)
- **Improve debugging** (git bisect, git blame)
- **Facilitate code reviews**
- **Document project evolution**

### Conventional Commits Standard

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Commit Types

```bash
feat:     New feature for the user
fix:      Bug fix for the user
docs:     Documentation changes
style:    Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
perf:     Performance improvements
test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
chore:    Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
build:    Changes that affect the build system or dependencies
revert:   Reverts a previous commit
```

#### Examples of Good Commit Messages

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good commit messages
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration with Google
fix(ui): resolve button alignment on mobile devices
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
refactor(db): optimize user query performance
test(auth): add unit tests for login validation
chore(deps): update lodash to version 4.17.21

# With body and footer
feat(payment): add Stripe payment integration

Integrate Stripe payment processing to handle:
- Credit card payments
- Subscription billing
- Webhook handling for payment events

Closes #123
Breaking change: Payment API endpoints have changed
```

## ‚öõÔ∏è Atomic Commits

### What are Atomic Commits?

Atomic commits are:
- **Self-contained**: Each commit represents one logical change
- **Complete**: The codebase works after the commit
- **Focused**: Only related changes are included
- **Reversible**: Can be safely reverted without side effects

### Creating Atomic Commits

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/auth/register.js
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user registration logic"

# Stage parts of files
git add -p src/auth/auth.js
# Select hunks to stage, commit related changes together

# Stage and commit in one go
git commit -am "fix(ui): resolve button styling issues"
```

## üåø Keeping Main Branch Clean

### Main Branch Principles

1. **Always deployable**: Main should be production-ready
2. **Never broken**: All tests pass
3. **Linear history**: Prefer merge commits or rebase
4. **Protected**: Use branch protection rules
5. **Up-to-date**: Regular integration of changes

### Branch Protection Rules

Set up in GitHub: Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule

```yaml
# Recommended protection rules:
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
‚úÖ Require review from code owners
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚úÖ Include administrators (enforce for everyone)
‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

## üîÑ Pull Regularly, Push Often

### The Golden Rule

**"Pull early, pull often, push frequently"**

### Daily Workflow Best Practices

```bash
# Start of day routine:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main  # Keep feature branch up-to-date

# During development:
# Every 2-3 hours or before major changes:
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# End of day routine:
git add .
git commit -m "feat(feature): progress on user dashboard"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

## üö© Feature Flags vs Long-Running Branches

### Feature Flags Solution

```javascript
// Feature flag implementation
const featureFlags = {
  newUserDashboard: process.env.FEATURE_NEW_DASHBOARD === 'true',
  enhancedSearch: process.env.FEATURE_ENHANCED_SEARCH === 'true'
};

// Usage in code
function renderDashboard() {
  if (featureFlags.newUserDashboard) {
    return <NewDashboard />;
  }
  return <LegacyDashboard />;
}
```

## üìÅ Branch Naming Conventions

### Consistent Naming Patterns

```bash
# Type-based naming:
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration
bugfix/login-validation
hotfix/security-patch
release/v1.2.0
experiment/new-ui-framework

# Issue-based naming:
feature/123-user-profiles
bugfix/456-memory-leak
hotfix/789-sql-injection

# User-based naming (for long-running work):
john/refactor-database
sarah/performance-optimization
```

### Naming Rules

1. **Use lowercase**: `feature/user-auth` not `Feature/User-Auth`
2. **Use hyphens**: `feature/user-auth` not `feature/user_auth`
3. **Be descriptive**: `fix/login-error` not `fix/bug`
4. **Keep reasonable length**: `feature/user-authentication`
5. **Include issue numbers**: `feature/123-user-profiles`

## üë• Team Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Review Standards

```markdown
## Code Review Checklist

```

### Team Workflow Agreements

```markdown
# Team Git Workflow Agreement

## Branching
- Create feature branches from main
- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes
- Keep branches short-lived (< 1 week)
- Delete branches after merging

## Commits
- Use conventional commit messages
- Make atomic commits
- Squash "fix typo" type commits before merging
- Test changes before committing

## Pull Requests
- Open draft PRs for early feedback
- Request specific reviewers
- Address all review comments
- Update PR description as changes are made

## Code Review
- Review PRs within 24 hours
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Test the changes locally when needed
- Approve only when confident in the changes
```

## üìã Module 9 Exercises

### Exercise 1: Commit Message Practice
1. Review your recent commits
2. Rewrite poor commit messages using conventional format
3. Practice writing descriptive commit messages
4. Set up commit message template

### Exercise 2: Atomic Commits
1. Make a large change affecting multiple areas
2. Break it into atomic commits
3. Practice staging changes selectively
4. Use interactive staging

### Exercise 3: Team Workflow
1. Set up branch protection rules
2. Create a team workflow agreement
3. Practice the PR review process
4. Implement feature flags in a project

### Exercise 4: Branch Management
1. Establish branch naming conventions
2. Set up automated branch cleanup
3. Practice frequent pulling and rebasing
4. Handle merge conflicts effectively

## üîß Troubleshooting Team Issues

### Common Problems

```bash
# Merge conflicts from infrequent pulling
git pull --rebase origin main  # Rebase instead of merge
git mergetool                  # Use merge tool for conflicts

# Accidental commits to main
git log --oneline -5           # Find the commits
git reset --soft HEAD~2        # Move commits to staging
git checkout -b feature/fix    # Create feature branch
git commit -m "Move commits to feature branch"

# Force push conflicts
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch  # Safer than --force
```

## üí° Advanced Team Practices

### Git Aliases for Teams

```bash
# Team-focused aliases
git config --global alias.contributors 'shortlog -sn'
git config --global alias.activity 'log --since="1 month ago" --oneline --all'
git config --global alias.standup 'log --since="yesterday" --author="$USER" --oneline'
git config --global alias.review 'log --oneline -10'

# Workflow aliases
git config --global alias.sync '!git checkout main && git pull origin main'
git config --global alias.feature '!f() { git sync && git checkout -b feature/$1; }; f'
```

### Pair Programming with Git

```bash
# Co-author commits when pair programming
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth login

Co-authored-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Co-authored-by: John Smith <john@example.com>"

# Switch driver during session
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: auth progress" # Temporary commit
git push origin feature/auth
# Other person pulls and continues
```

### Code Review Culture

```markdown
## Creating a Positive Review Culture

### For Authors
- Self-review before requesting review
- Provide context in PR description
- Be responsive to feedback
- Don't take feedback personally

### For Reviewers
- Assume positive intent
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Recognize good code
- Focus on learning opportunities

### For Teams
- Establish review guidelines
- Regular retrospectives on review process
- Share knowledge through reviews
- Balance thorough review with velocity
```
